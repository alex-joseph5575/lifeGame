Known Limitations:
  - Different modes are accessed by tweaking the main method. Just change the object between ClassicMode, DoughnutMode, and MirrorMode to acccess each game mode.
  - When both reading a map from a file and outputting to the file, the console will print an error message after entering the output file name. It can be ignored and the map file name can be inputted afterwards.
  - When creating a map file, you must use the characters '-' (dash) and 'X' to represent an empty space and a cell respectively. Other characters will not be recognized.
